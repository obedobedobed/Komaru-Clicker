# Komaru-Clicker
Komaru Clicker made with C# and Avalonia
My first game without an engine

If u wanna build it urself go to csproj directory and run the command:

`dotnet publish -c Release -r (platform (win-x64 for example) --self -contained (true/false) -p:PublishSingleFile=(true/false)`

For build u must have .NET 8

Your game saves will be here: (user directory)/.ObedGaming/KomaruClicker/data.json
